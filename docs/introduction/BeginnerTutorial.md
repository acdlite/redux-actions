## Beginner Tutorial

### Installation

For NPM users

```bash
$ npm install --save redux-actions
```

For Yarn users

```bash
$ yarn add redux-actions
```

For UMD users

The [UMD](https://unpkg.com/redux-actions@latest/dist) build exports a global called `window.ReduxActions` if you add it to your page via a `<script>` tag. We *donâ€™t* recommend UMD builds for any serious application, as most of the libraries complementary to Redux are only available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=redux).
